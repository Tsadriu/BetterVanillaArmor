# Better Vanilla Armor

This datapack is vanilla friendly, and the purpose of this pack is to enhance the existing armors in the game, without rendering them too strong.
## Leather armor
This armor set increases the height from which you can fall without taking damage. Normally, you start receiving fall damage when falling from a height of 4 blocks or more. With this armor, the threshold increases significantly, allowing you to fall from up to 13 blocks without harm. Fall damage begins from a height of 14 blocks.

### Specifics
* Helmet:
	* +2 blocks of fall damage prevention. 
* Chestplate:
	* +5 blocks of fall damage prevention.
* Leggings:
	* +2 blocks of fall damage prevention.
* Boots:
	* +1 blocks of fall damage prevention.


## Iron armor
Iron armor is the most common type of armor, typically used during the early and mid-game phases. It fulfills its defensive role effectively. When wearing the full set, your attack speed increases by 15%, making it particularly advantageous for those who prefer using an Axe over a Sword.

### Specifics
* Helmet:
	* +4% attack speed. 
* Chestplate:
	* +5% attack speed.
* Leggings:
	* +4% attack speed.
* Boots:
	* +2% attack speed.

## Chainmail armor
Chainmail armor, while available in the game and occasionally found in treasure chests or obtained from mobs, offers no additional benefits over iron armor despite its rarity. To enhance its utility and justify its rarity, this armor set has been revamped to facilitate exploration. When wearing the full set, you will automatically "climb" blocks up to 1.25 blocks high (e.g., a block and a slab) and receive a 4% permanent increase in movement speed. Additionally, the crafting recipe has also been added.
### Specifics
* Helmet:
	* +0.25 block height climb
	* +0.5% movement speed. 
* Chestplate:
	* +0.5 block height climb
	* +1% movement speed.
* Leggings:
	* +0.25 block height climb
	* +1% movement speed.
* Boots:
	* +0.25 block height climb
	* +0.5% movement speed.

## Gold armor
Gold armor is rarely used due to its low durability, which is worse than any other armor except Leather. To make gold armor more appealing and functional, it has been revamped to benefit anyone that needs to destroy many blocks quickly. When wearing the full set, you gain a +3 break speed bonus.
### Specifics
* Helmet:
	* +0.5 break speed
* Chestplate:
	* +1.5 break speed
* Leggings:
	* +0.75 break speed
* Boots:
	* +0.25 break speed

## Diamond armor
Diamond armor, the original end-game armor, provides excellent defense but has been somewhat overshadowed by Netherite armor. To give players a reason to choose diamond armor over Netherite, it has been enhanced with a range boost. When wearing the full set, you gain a +2.5 block range for placing and breaking blocks, as well as interacting with or attacking entities.
### Specifics
* Helmet:
	* +0.5 Block place/break range
	* +0.5 Entity interage/attack range
* Chestplate:
	* +1 Block place/break range
	* +1 Entity interage/attack range
* Leggings:
	* +0.5 Block place/break range
	* +0.5 Entity interage/attack range
* Boots:
	* +0.5 Block place/break range
	* +0.5 Entity interage/attack range

## Netherite armor
Netherite armor, the current best-in-slot end-game armor, provides excellent defense and has been minimally altered to preserve its top-tier status. To enhance its role in the "tank" category, making it ideal for sustaining damage during difficult encounters (such as pillager raids), the armor now grants additional knockback resistance and extra hearts when wearing the full set.
### Specifics
* Helmet:
	* +1 Knockback resistance
	* +1 Heart
* Chestplate:
	* +1 Knockback resistance
	* +1 Heart
* Leggings:
	* +1 Knockback resistance
	* +1 Heart
* Boots:
	* +1 Knockback resistance
	* +1 Heart
